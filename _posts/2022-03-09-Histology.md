**Histology protocols**- 

**Fixation**-

●	1.5 ml FSW (0.2 microns filtered seawater) in a 15 ml tube (for small fragments). 

●	Cut the sample into approximately 2 cm fragments and place them in the tube.

●	Leave the fragments in the tube with the FSW for 10 min before adding 1M mgcl2. 

●	Add 0.3 ml of 1M mgcl2 to a single tube, and cover the plate with foil for 10 min. 

●	Remove the FSW from the tube.

●	Add 4% formaldehyde solution into the tube. 

●	Second option - leave the 1.8 ml of FSW and 1M mgcl2 solution in the tube and add 0.5 ml of 16% Formaldehyde to the tube for a final concentration of 4%. 

●	Leave at 4°C overnight, Or 1-2 hr At room temperature.

●	Wash X3 with sterile PBS solution. 

●	For extended storage, store in 70% sterile ethanol, or leave in PBS for short storage of 2-3 days.

**Paraffin embedded tissue**- 

●	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.

●	For scleractinian- decalcification of the skeleton with 1:1 formic acid (50% in DDW) & Sodium citrate 20% (20% in DDW). 

●	Transfer the fixed sample into 50 ml tubes and add the decalcification solution (10 ml in each tube - for samples bigger than 3 cm add 15 ml) for 4-5 hours\overnight. 

●	Wash X3 with PBS in RT, 15 min each.

●	Dehydrate the tissue through a series of graded ethanol (with PBS) 50%, 75%, 90% and 100%, 15 min each. If the tissue is more than 2mm thick extend the last step (100%) to 30min. 

●	Clear the tissue through a series of graded Xylene or butanol (with ethanol) 50%, 75%, 90% and 100%, 30 min each.

●	Remove the butanol and insert the tissue into a glass vial (#2) with melted paraffin, incubate 1h. 

●	Transfer the tissue into another new glass vial (#3) with melted paraffin Incubate in 580c-600c over-night.

●	Transfer the tissue into the 4th glass vial (#4) with melted paraffin for 2h.  

●	Take the tissue out of the glass vial and place it in the correct position in the mold.

●	Pour the melted paraffin on the tissue, until the paraffin covers the whole tissue.

●	Let it chill on ice for a few hours and then transfer to 40c overnight.


![Blocks]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Blocks.png "Blocks")

**Save paraffin blocks at RT (in case of extra heated places it is better to store the block inside a box in a minus 40c fridge).
Before sectioning in microtome, chill the blocks on ice or in ice-cold water.**


**Tissue sectioning** (Microtome)- 

**Equipment**: Knives, Acetone, brush, DDW, pencil, slides, slides boxes, scalpel, small tweezers, ice.  

●	Remove the block from the mold and gently mark with the scalpel a square surrounding the tissue location. 

●	Start peeling off the edges until the square of the tissue area is sticking out.

●	Place the scalped block on ice for a few minutes. 

●	Clean the knife and the knife’s surface with Acetone. 

●	Place the block on the microtome and adjust the knife location.

●	Start slicing sections from the block (10 μm each).  


**Stains**- 

**Equipment**: large beaker with DDW, small beaker for waste, pink tubes with ethanol,100% ethanol, glass pipette, stains kit. 

●	Place 1 drop of Hematoxylin on each tissue slice for 1 minute. 

●	Preliminary wash- with pipette into the waste tank.

●	Second wash- 10 seconds inside the DDW beaker.

●	Place 1 drop of Bluing reagent on each tissue slice for 15 seconds.

●	Preliminary wash-with pipette. 

●	Second wash-inside the DDW beaker. 

●	Dip slides inside a pink tube # 1 with 100% ethanol for 10 seconds.

●	Dip slides inside a pink tube # 2 with 100% ethanol for 10 seconds.

●	Place 1 drop of Eosin on each tissue slice for 2-3 minutes. 

●	Wash with 100% ethanol for 10 seconds (use pipette).

●	Dehydrate with 100% ethanol (pink tubes) for 1-minute X3. 


**Coverslip**- 

**Equipment**: Scotch super glue, cover glasses, 80% Glycerol.  

•	Place 2 drop of 80% Glycerol on the center of the slide (make sure that there is enough glycerol to cover all the sample).

•	Place 4 little drops on the corners of the cover glass and immediately place it on the slide. 


**Notes**- 
-	Do not dehydrate the sample (glycerol should be placed immediately after the slide is carried out from the 100% ethanol tube). 
-	It is possible to use DPX glue instead on stained samples, (again make sure not to dehydrate the slide before placing the glue). 
-	DPX gluing must be done in a hood.
